<h3> A Simple Calculator </h3>

To start off, I have created a simple calculator with simple functionality (add, subtract, divide and multiply). It takes user input and stores each number in a seperate variable. Following this, the user is prompted for an option, [a], [s], [d] or [m] with each letter corresponding to the beginning letter of the mathematical operation they wish to use. The input is then converted into lower case. Each number is passed into the corresponding function that we created to perform our mathematical operation. This will return the value and present it to the user. We use an if statement to run through the conditions of the users option and select the relevant function to return the correct result to the user. 

This is a very simple calculator and I plan to add further functionality and potentially a user interface to this later down the line using tkinter. However, I created this as a demonstration of simple readable code, good coding practices and a calculator is always useful to have! 

Update 1:
I have decided to contain the conditional statement inside of a function just to clean up the code a little more. 

Update 2:
To add a little better flow to the program for the user, I imported time so I could use sleep() throughout my program. It breaks up the input a little and the result from the end message so the user can see there calculation clearly. I also cleaned up the code a little more as I noticed a few things I could do to improve readability. 

I plan to later to include tkinter into this project. I have previously learned it, but I would like to become a little more fluent with it as I didnt spend much time with it previously. However, I currently have my hands tied down with Chat Bots and Natural Language Proecessing. I also plan to have another shell calculator similar to this which will interact with the user and give human-like responses, loop through the program if the user wishes and close out the program with simple words like 'goodbye' or 'close'
