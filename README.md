<h3> A Simple Calculator </h3>

To start off, I have created a simple calculator with simple functionality (add, subtract, divide and multiply). It takes user input and stores each number in a seperate variable. Following this, the user is prompted for an option, [a], [s], [d] or [m] with each letter corresponding to the beginning letter of the mathematical operation they wish to use. The input is then converted into lower case. Each number is passed into the corresponding function that we created to perform our mathematical operation. This will return the value and present it to the user. We use an if statement to run through the conditions of the users option and select the relevant function to return the correct result to the user. 

This is a very simple calculator and I plan to add further functionality and potentially a user interface to this later down the line using tkinter. However, I created this as a demonstration of simple readable code, good coding practices and a calculator is always useful to have!
